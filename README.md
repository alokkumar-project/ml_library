Hello everyone!
In this repository, I have implemented several machine learning algorithms from scratch using only NumPy and Pandas, without relying on high-level libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow. The goal of this project is to deeply understand the mathematical foundations and inner workings of core machine learning algorithms

Implemented Algorithms:
1.Linear Regression
2.Polynomial Regression
3.Logistic Regression
4.Decision Tree
5.Nueral Network(Fully connected)
6.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
7.K-Means Clustering
Feel free to explore the code, raise issues, or suggest improvements.⭐ Contributions and feedback are welcome!
