Hello everyone!
In this repository, I have implemented several machine learning algorithms from scratch using only NumPy and Pandas, without relying on high-level libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow. The goal of this project is to deeply understand the mathematical foundations and inner workings of core machine learning algorithms

Implemented Algorithms:
1.Linear Regression/Polynomial Regression
2.Logistic Regression
3.Decision Tree
4.Nueral Network(Fully connected)
5.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
6.K-Means Clustering
